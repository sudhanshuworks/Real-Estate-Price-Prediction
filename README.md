# **Real-Estate-Price-Prediction**
In this data set i am going to use regression algorithm for predicting the price of the apartment in perticular location. the data set which i am using over here is House.csv file
</bn> 
# **Required Libraries**
*pandas (load and manipulate data and for One-Hot Encoding)

*numpy (calculate the mean and standard deviation)

*seaborn (some graphs)

*sklearn.model_selection , train_test_split (split data into training and testing sets)

*sklearn.model_selection , GridSearchCV (cross validation)

*sklearn.metrics , confusion_matrix (creates a confusion matrix)

*sklearn.metrics , plot_confusion_matrix (draws a confusion matrix)

*matplotlib.pyplot

# **Data Cleaning: Handle NA values**
<br />drop na value
<br />df3= df2.dropna()
<br />df3.isnull().sum()

# **Feature Engineering**
# **please checkout the Predicting House Prices.ipynb **
